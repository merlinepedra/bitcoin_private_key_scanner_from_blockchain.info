Check out Wiki of this repo to find out how to install and run!

**!!Warning from Darktea admin!!:** Code is obfuscated python code. I can't verify what it does. This could be ransomware.

**Dear Admin** now is one weeks since I did first commit did you tried it to confirm is or is not **ransomware**? If is please delete my account otherwise do not warning people without any reason pls ... Do you think is fair now to put down your website by DDOS attack? Just because I am thinking you are hating me... what do you think? Is or is not fair?

Dear Admin it is not ransomware, I was obfuscated because there are few sintaxes what are not easy to get them in order to scan Blockchain.info my sugestion is for everyone to use Whonix, Tail or Qubes by TOR network, this app is not required to share any Bitcoin Private Keys it is finding for you bitcoin private keys. 

I will add soon a gif how is working from installation to run. Anyway is good because you flagged it as possible malware but I will proof is not.

Great day!
